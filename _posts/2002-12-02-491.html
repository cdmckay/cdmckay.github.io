Well, I guess this begins the first page of my government profile which I may or may not one day regret writing.  But I guess there's not much I can about that but not write a journal... and I'm not about to do that.  And no, I'm not going to tell you my reasoning.

But anyway, I've been trying to get one of these LiveJournal registration codes for the longest time from Rev (Hi) but to no avail.  Then suddenly, one day, Andre writes me an ICQ message pointing me to his journal.  In the past, he had written a journal on his old webspace at GlobalServe (remember ~aquaship?) so I thought it was just that and clicked just in case there would be something of some interest.  Suddenly I whisked away to the land of LJ, and I was like what the fuck?  How?  What?  Then I realized that people other than Rev could possibly have LJ accounts!

Anyway, I guess I should do what's expected of me and blabber on about my day.  Last night I went to bed at a reasonable time in order to get up at a reasonable time this morning.  To ensure this, I enlisted the help of my housemate Brian.  He promised to wake me up at 9:00 am.  So anyway, sure as hell, this morning at 9:05 I get a knock on my door by him.  I tell him I've got my alarm set for 9:15, followed by a "fuck off" (not in a rude way I assure you.)  He then proceeds to give me a speech about how I should get up because the peoples of our fine nation depend on me getting up in the morning or something along those lines.  I thanked him for his moving speech and he left.  I went to sleep again only to awoken by my oh-so-awesome alarm.  After snoozing for 15 minutes I get up and eat some grub.

After about an hour of dicking around doing nothing, I... oh shit, I'm dicking around right now.  I guess I'll have to finish this later after I get a little more studying done.
