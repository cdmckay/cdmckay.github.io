Well, I just got back from my first exam (the algebra one I mentionned last entry) and I have a good feeling about it. I'm quite certain that I passed and I guessing I got an 80-85% on it, which is good, as that'll boost my mark in that course significantly.

I actually just finished eating a rather meat-centric dinner consisting of two spiced burgers from the local deli up the road and, well, they left a lot to be desired. I cooked them for about 20 minutes at which point I figured, well, that they'd be cooked. Silly me. As I bite into on of them it leaks all this nasty reddish juice and it almost completely raw inside.  
So I ask Farron, "Does this look done to you?"  
Farron takes a look at it, "Well, you're not going to <i>die</i> from eating it. I mean, you'll probably have indigestion for about a day."
Greg, hearing Farron say that, takes a look, "That's not done."
"Well, you see, Greg grew up in a house where they cooked things, but at my place, we wouldn't of even threw it on the grill," Farron adds.
I nod my head, weighing the arguments, and decide to throw it on the grill.

In the meantime, I go upstairs and check my e-mail, as well as open up Slashdot. Nothing particularly interesting on Slashdot (America's First WCMDA call or some shit) or in the e-mail.

My burgers are still sizzling away on the frying pan, no closer to being more cooked than they were before (except now they're blacker) so I decide to pop 'em in the microwave and let technology do it's magic. Two minutes later I'm eating the (much tougher) burgers. But I digress, I guess I'm full now so they were good enough.

I guess I should start studying for my next exam (well my next important exam) on the 11th. Vector Calculus baby.
