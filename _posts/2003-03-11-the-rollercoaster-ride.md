Well, I suppose it's the time of the month (year?) that I update my journal. My life has been really interesting and all over the place lately. I'm not going to go into any detail since I'm not a huge fan of broadcasting my life to the masses.

Regardless, since I last spoke I've begun picking up the guitar. And I don't mean I just pick it up and put it down. I mean I've started learning it. And I feel I've been getting pretty decent at it. My chording fingers are now partially callused and I've learned "Wish You Were Here" by Floyd so I'm well on my way to becoming the generic guitar playing college student. I've still yet to learn barre chords (which I really want to do so I can learn "Say It Ain't So") but that's good. I always like a challenge.

School is going horrible. There are even classes I suspect I might fail. This is bad (tm) because, well, I like my program immensely when I can concentrate. Thing is, I can't right now, which is understandable but a bit frustrating. Sometimes I wonder how people ever get anything done. Life is so complicated and, being a sensitive and somewhat courteous person, I like to well, keep things running smoothly? I'm not really sure what I'm talking about but I'll write it anyway.

On a side note, I was talking to Jenn today on the phone about how interesting it would be to read about our parents live journals (which, naturally, don't exist.) I'm talking about our kids, of course. They will have an immense amount of insight into their parents past if they read these and I don't know if it's a good or bad thing. I mean when I was young I always pictured my parents as immortal figures that always knew what the fuck to do. It was only until my later teens that I realized that they're just as mortal as we are. Even more like us because we're their progeny. Anywho, I think it's interesting to think about.

And just to be weird, I'll say this: son, or daughter, or new breed of third (or fourth) gender (according to Alex's heterosexism handout), life is not as bad as we make it sound. If you're going through a tough time and feel like it's not worth it, wait. Good things happen to good people, always. If something seems like it's the worst possible thing to happen, wait it out. It usually ends up being for the better. There's a plan, not God's plan, but a plan. It's neither deterministic or free choice, it's both (I know, I know, mind-blowing!) but just stick with it. Remember, you are only truly free if you are doing whatever is most difficult. Going with the flow is slavery. Remember, the ultimate number is 4 (2\*2 = 4, 2^2 = 4, 2+2=4.) Hopefully, by the time you read this, young progeny, I'll be a great mathematician and people will be learning about McKay's Theorem :)
