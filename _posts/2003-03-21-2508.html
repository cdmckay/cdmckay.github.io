Just got back from Jenn's after doing a mocha run to refuel her for her essay writing night ahead.  Was talking to Tom today about getting my hair cut and he mentionned that he only cuts his hair like once a year.  Once a freaking year.  Now, I can understand individuals with long hair not getting their hair cut frequently but he has hair shorter than I!  Perhaps I'm just used to my faster growing uberhair.

But regardless (or irregardless, as the Rev would prefer) of that, the real reason for this update is the spooky dreams I've been having lately.  The first one happened the other day.  In the dream (which is rather vague now since it's been about two days) I'm in my Toyota Previa minivan with my father and it's pouring rain outside.  He's driving like a maniac and he's crying his eyes out.  We had just found out my brother Matt had died at the hospital and we were going to see him.  (Just for the record, he's not dead.  Actually, he's quite healthy.)  We're at the top of some huge hill hill on the road and I can't see anything around us because of the rain.  All of the sudden he turns of the road and goes over these rocks.  So naturally I freak out and say "Dad, what the hell are you doing?" Strangely enough, we pass over these rocks without a problem and are back on the road again.  This is were it's sketchy.  I think we go into the hospital and talk to the doctor or something and he fucked up.  It's hard to say.  I think the hospital looked like a greenhouse.

So I wake up from this dream and am kind of upset since I actually thought my brother had died and was (naturally) pretty upset.  So I realize he's OK and eventually fall back asleep.  Now, in the same night, I start dreaming about Jenn.  I'm at this party and I'm really upset.  I'm standing by some non-descript fridge and there's pictures of Jenn and I and I'm crying as I look at them because for some reason she has died now.  I'm thinking to myself as I look at these pictures: <i>I guess we weren't meant to be together, but this is a really harsh way of showing me.  I miss her so much.</i>  Then, all of the sudden, I'm at a music store/car dealership looking at this strange, futuristic car and all of the sudden I think it would be a good idea to ask the guys that run the place if I could get a summer job there.  Fucking weird.

Ok, now, last night I dream I'm in some house and all kinds of wacky shit involving aliens happens (which I can't remember enough to tell a coherent story about) but in the end I'm looking out the window at Earth (which is where the moon should be) and all of the sudden a huge nuclear blast erupts on it.  I get this really freaky gut feeling that the blast must be only seconds away from me and I'm as good as dead.  It was possibly the scariest feeling I've ever had in my life.  But as I wait, it never comes.  And I look up and am confused suddenly because I realize that I'm looking at Earth from Earth.  Isn't the moon supposed to be there?  Then the moon <b>is</b> there!  But so is Earth.  I think this overloaded my positronic matrix as I don't remember anything after that.
