Well it's around 4:38 PM on Tuesday and, guess what, I'm behind in my studies.  I skipped two classes today for no particular reason other than I didn't feel like going (which, I guess, is a reason itself.)  I've done a minimal amount of studying for one of my quizzes this Thursday.  Of course it's for the easier one, as I would never actually want to use my brain.

Last night Jenn came over after some function at Queen's Pub and worked one of her eighty billion essays due in the next couple weeks.  While she did that I tried to study for electrodynamics but didn't get as much done as I had hoped and am quite sure I got zero on it this morning.  No big deal though, I can make up half of it.  Anyway an incident occurred that made me believe that whenever things in my life are going well there's always some little dude who sits in my head and throws a wrench in the gears to mess me up.  Not that I wouldn't be good at screwing things up without the little dude.  In fact, I think I have an innate skill at making stupid mistakes :)

But I really hope Jenn's not too upset with me.  This morning while I was listening to my alarm go off I tried to imagine what I would have felt like given everything was reversed.  It was quite a bit harder than I had expected and I really got no new information out of it other than "I don't know how I'd feel."

Oh well, I suppose life will go on.  The sun will more likely than not rise tomorrow and I will probably have to go pee within the next 30 minutes.  The Rev (<lj user=heraclitus>), whom I accidentally forgot to drive home this weekend, gave me a call and asked if I wanted to poke some smot.  I told him perhaps and then made arrangements to head to Morrison's for din-din.  The dishes in the kitchen here haven't been washed for four days and it looks like shithole.  I think I'd rather just dole out the five bucks it costs to eat there.  I still haven't decided whether or not I'll smoke with him.  On one hand, getting high is usually fun but on the other hand, I should be using this time to catchup on my work.  Grrrr.... the hard decisions I must make in my life.

I suppose I should try to get some studying done before I talk to the Rev at 6:00 PM.  I feel so strange today, kind of the middle between happy and sad.  I really need to get out and get hammered this weekend, or at least get out and have some fun.
