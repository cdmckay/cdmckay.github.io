It's about 2:44 AM and I'm just chilling at my computer after a week of doing nothing. Luckily my job starts next week either Wednesday or Thursday, depending on what my boss says when he finally gets back to me.

Just got back from the girlfriend's, actually. Really good time tonight, we went out to dinner, watched a movie (can't remember the name but it had Hugh Grant and Rachel Weisz in it) followed by a watching of Conan. A bunch of good conversations in the car and miscellaneous places. She's really awesome. I don't know how we spent so much time apart...

It's interesting to think about, really. Our relationship has evolved in so many different ways over time yet we can still have a good time together after all that has happened. Strangely, even though some not so good stuff has happened, it feels like it was all necessary. Kind of like how you know, for instance, that an axiom is true (obligatory nerd reference.)

Actually it was kind of funny at dinner today. Jenn asked me what Star Trek was all about.
"Like the plot?" I ask.
"What are they doing?" She queries.
"Their explorers," I explain, "They're there to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before."
She recognizes the reference and gives me a face. I smile like a dork talking about Star Trek with his girlfriend at dinner.
