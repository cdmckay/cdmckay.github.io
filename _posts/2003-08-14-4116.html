I'm sitting here about to write some brilliant insights while Wyner rolls T-man a "personal" joint...  of "tobacco" of course.  Just read Rev's journal where he extols the seemingly infinite "rockitude" of the Iliad.  Then he said he had no weed, which saddens me, considering we have more than no weed...  we have <i>weed</i>.  Oh well... the suckitude of living in K-Town when no dealers are there, eh Rev?

I have an interesting story to share, one that you haven't yet heard T-man.  I went to the hospital Monday and, naturally, had to find a place to park.  Due to my incredible foresight, I thought to ask my mother, an ex-nurse at that very hospital, where would be a good place to park.  She told me about this random one-way side street and explained how to get there.  Good.  I eventually get to this street and find this nice parking spot and pull in.

Well, while I'm pulling in I look out the passenger window and noticed two trolls and an fat ogre champion sitting on their porch smoking or devouring dead babies or something.  Regardless, I do my best to avoid eye contact and exit my automobile complete with my "Rise of Endymion" book, knowing I'll be in the waiting room for about two eternities.  As I am exiting said automobile, the ogre champion challenges me:

Ogre (in barely comprehensible slur): "Yer blockin tha driveway."
<i>I inspect my parking job and find this to be untrue.</i>
Cameron (in completely respectable tone): "Kind gentleman, you appear to be mistaken.  I have blocked no driveway."
<i>Ogre exchanges glances with troll friends/wives/concubines.</i>
Ogre: "The driveway, you can't..." (gestures clumsily) "... get out."
<i>Cameron had realised before the conversation began that the direct result of a blocked driveway is that the car cannot exit.</i>
Cameron (gesturing at the completely open driveway):  "You can go <i>HERE</i>."
<i>Ogres mutters incomprehensibly.  Cameron detects something along the lines of "don't be surprised if your car gets keyed."  What?  What the <i>FUCK</i> is that?  Who are these fucking people?</i>

Anyway, that's about all I have.  'Til next time :)

Side Note:  I wrote this entry while quite... enlightened.  I just fixed the spelling up now :) (2003-08-14 @ 12:34 PM)
