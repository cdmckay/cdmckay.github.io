The Dephic Expanse.  The theme of this season of Enterprise takes place where the season finale left off.  Earth was attacked by a mysterious race called the Xindi and now <i>Enterprise</i> is set with the task to figure out who the fuck they are.  Sounds pretty lame and I was kind of worried that they were going to ruin what I figured was a pretty good addition to the series (though I have determined I am a minority.)

Anyway, I just finished watching episode two and can say that it's turning out not to be that bad.  Though I prefer the exploration style of the first two seasons, the third season has really fixed up Captain Archer's image.  He used to be kind of a fucktard who always had hokey speeches that made me feel awkward just watching.  The new Archer kicks some ass.  He's perpetually really angry and agitated, and it makes him a helluva cooler captain.

Well, that's all for now folks.  Sleep is calling.  And maybe a poop before that.
