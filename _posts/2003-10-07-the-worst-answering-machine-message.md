I think I just possibly left the worst answering machine message in my life a couple of moments ago. Now I know why I hate those fucking machines. Never leaving a message again! Wow, though.

This message was like an awkward scene from a comedy where the guy just totally fucks it up and pretty much sounds, hmmm, pretty damn scary. Man, I don't even want to repeat it. Something along the lines of "Hey, it's Cameron, my number is ###-####, no, actually, that's your number, but anyway, I was just wondering what you were up to tomorrow, my number here is ###-#### (this time I said it right). Thanks. Bye."

I mean I know why I said her number, because I just called it but still. Weird. Oh well, guess it's back to square one. I figure this probably happened for a reason, so hey. Nothing lost, nothing gained. But fuck, grrr... oh well.
