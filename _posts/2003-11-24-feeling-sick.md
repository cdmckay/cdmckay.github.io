I'm feeling pretty sick. Yesterday I woke up feeling horrible (physically not mentally) and things only got worse as the day went on. By the night, I was shivering and my skin was completely goosebumped. As if that wasn't enough I had a dehabilitating headache and was burning up. Wonderful day it was. Finally, I was forced to pop some of Farron's Neo-Citrin to knock me out, although the sleep was feverish and patchy at best. This morning I woke up drenched in sweat but thankfully felt much better.

Because of this wonderfully timed fever, I couldn't go to class today, though that's not a big deal today since I have nothing really important (other than Philosophy of Science.) Hopefully this thing will subside by the end of the week, considering next week is exams.
