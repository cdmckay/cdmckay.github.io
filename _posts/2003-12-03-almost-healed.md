      couldn't be.
      sometimes all you want to do is quote lyrics. But they never feel the same in review. A journal isn't there for intellectual competition. Last night we were at coreys house for leafs game. but his uncles were there so I had to sit on a table. good ol' corey.

Well I'm almost completely healed these days. My gums are still slightly pained but nothing I can't handle. I can eat almost everything I did before I was sick and I'm sleeping fine (that is, without the aid of six ACCs.) I think the most interesting thing that came out of being as sick as I was for that week, other than the realization that being terminally ill would be really really depressing, was that for the first time since who knows when I wasn't obsessed with girls. That's right. I was in so much pain that I couldn't even think about girls. And I <b>always</b> think about girls. What's even better, is that I don't miss it. I don't care. It's not that I don't want a girlfriend and that I'll avoid it. That's not it at all. It's just that I'm not going to be crazy about it. It's a strangely liberated feeling.

In other news, I wrote my first exam today. It was a math one. "Functions of the Complex Variable" is the official name. Really exciting shit. I'm hoping I got out of this one alive as I spent several days studying.

I also finished Illium the other day and while there is some closure on some of the story arcs, there's a lot left hanging for the second book <i>Olympos</i> which will come out sometime between now and the end of time. Since I grabbed <i>Illium</i> in hardcover I suppose I'll have to grab <i>Olympos</i> similarly or they won't match and we don't want THAT to happen (read: obsessive compulsive behavior kicking in.)

Ah well, my little break from studying for Microprocessor Systems must end now. 'Til next time, little ones, stay out of trouble. Especially you. That's right, you know who I'm talking about.
