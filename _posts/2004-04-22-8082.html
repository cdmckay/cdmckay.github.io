Things you want to happen always happen when you least expect them.  Without exception, I find this to be the story of my life.  If I go out some night and even think idly about some farfetched situation happening, it never happens.  I think as soon as I think about the possibility of a given situation taking place, I automatically preclude it from happening.  This situation, of course, is only precluded if it would be something positive.  If I, for instance, imagined that I did <i>not</i> get raped on a mid-term it unfortunately does not affect the inevitable outcome.

But maybe there's a link.  For example, in the midterm case, there is much more control than the case where I imagine myself running into a girl I'm interested in.  In the midterm case, I can ensure my own demise simply by putting no effort into it.  Similarly, in the random girl scenario, I can ensure I don't run into her by looking for her, or more interestingly, I make choices that I think increase my chances, but actually end up decreasing my chances.  Though once this happens you get into the tragic second-guess your second-guess recursion, which leads nowhere.  For instance, if I plan on going to point A, but then decide to go to point B because I think I'm more likely to run into this person, only to find out said person went to point A in the end.

Now this is where things get frustrating, especially for someone who understands the helplessness of his position (i.e. being human and therefore having little control of your surroundings) but does not want to wait around.  You realize that you can't really do anything to put yourself into a position of finding someone unless you don't try.  That is, your best strategy for success is to do nothing special.

At first, this seems really cruel.  You want to increase your chances, but the only way to do this, is to do nothing.  That is, you want to do something, but the something you need to do is nothing.  Isn't that a little fucked up?  At worst, it means you have no control.  At best, it simply means go out and have a good time, and stop preoccupying yourself with things that, though important, aren't so important that they need an entire livejournal entry.

I rest my case.
