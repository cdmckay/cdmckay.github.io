This is probably going to be a short one. And it pertains to how indescribable (is that the right word?) and unknowable the events of life are. Things can happen that make you rapidly redefine things that you were so pessimistic about. A hope, dimmed due to dust and wear and tear over the years, shines brightly again. You write vague poetic sentences in your LiveJournal.

I think I'll leave it at that.
