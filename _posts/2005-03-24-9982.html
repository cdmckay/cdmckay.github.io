So I've been thinking lately.  Some of the things I think about make me feel a little down, some of the things I think about elate me, some of things I think about piss me off and some of them terrify me.  The point I'm trying to make is, I don't just think happy thoughts.  In fact, I'd say the around 80% of my thoughts are disagreeable to me.  But I still think about them.  And why not?  Why should I stop any line of thinking just because I don't like what it'll lead to.  Why should I be willfully ignorant to facets of my imagination just because they may not make me happy?

The reason I bring this up is because I was talking to some people.  Specifically two, so I don't know if this is a pattern, or these two people are the only two people in the world that do this.  And when I related to them unhappy thoughts that I'd explored, they asked me why I'd think about them.  The question confused me.  I told them that I wouldn't not think about something just because it I didn't like what it might lead to.  That just doesn't make sense.  They told me that I would probably be a lot happier if I did ignore these thoughts.  So what?  I'd rather be miserable but exploring the full spectrum of thought then be a happy fuck would lives in a fantasy world.

In my life news, I'm still waiting on my graduate school applications.  Right now I'm expecting decisions from McGill and Queen's any day and finishing up applications for Dalhousie, Concordia and UVic.  I'd prefer to go to Montreal, and really don't want to go to Queen's, but it all depends on who accepts me.
