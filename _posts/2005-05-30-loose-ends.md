Well, I'm now officially an engineer. This past weekend was spent in Kingston indulging in hedonistic practices such as smoking copious amounts of marijuana, drinking beer and eating whatever my stoner mind desired. Oh yeah, and I was convocated too.

As for the Kat thing, it doesn't hurt that much anymore. Her and I fired e-mails back and forth and spoke on the phone at length and discovered some sort of middle ground. I'm not really going to go into it, but I feel that I should resolve the situation in this journal before I go back to keeping personal details to a minimum (remember, the Man is probably using this to build a psychological profile on me, so I need to make it as difficult as possible.)

The summer so far has been rather dull. At first I thought it was going to be a lot of fun as I had something to do (go periodically see Kat) while at the same time I had a pretty laid back job (the same job I had the last few summers) and thus could follow my own intellectual pursuits (whatever they may be.) Now, I have no Kat, just an pseudo-relationship, still have the laid back job, and haven't been following my pursuits like I thought I would. Why is the summer so boring? Is the summer what life is like without school? I certainly hope not, as that would be a relatively unexciting existence. I crave the student lifestyle. It seems like the perfect mix of responsibility and lack of responsibility. You're growing intellectually, while at the same time you can party and meet tons of new people and friends. How could life get any better? Hell, I don't know what I'm talking about.

Gotta think.
