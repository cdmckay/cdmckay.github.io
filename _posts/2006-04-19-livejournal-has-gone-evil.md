Well, now that LiveJournal has officially gone [evil](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/04/20/0312230), it looks like I have to move my blog over to Blogger. On the bright side, I'm saving Google the trouble of having to collect my personal blog information.

I'd write more, but I'm a tad tired.
