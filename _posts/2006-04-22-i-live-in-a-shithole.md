      Ain't it the truth, brother? I live and shower in this environment every day, and I don't give it a second thought.

      Comments like that just really rule a person out for marriage. Could you in a million years get married to some harpy that complains about every last thing?

      you're really a cat lady and that's why your place looks like it has the squalor and putrid feces buildup from 50 cats. someone should call the fucking humane society on you crazy cat ladies.

Why does everyone always feel obliged to tell you that you live in a shithole? I live in a shithole. I know this. I've known this for the 8 months I've been living here. You coming to my house and telling me it's a shithole is not news. It's rude.

Why do I bring this up? Well it seems that everytime someone brings somone adulty to our apartment, they have to put their nose in the air and complain about how gross it is. And then refuse to use our washroom or something. Well this is what I have to say to you:
Get the fuck out of my house.
Thanks.

Moving on. It's been quite a while since I last updated. I can't even recall what I last posted about (on LiveJournal, not Blogger). I'm now a graduate student at Queen's University at Kingston. I work in a building that feels like a converted sanitarium. All the walls are concrete, and my lab has exposed pipes on the ceiling. However, I don't mind that. What I find really annoying is people who ride the elevator up or down 1 floor. Unacceptable. You may only use the elevator to go up or down 3 or more floors. 2 floors in the gray area, and I'll tolerate it sometimes. But 1 floor? Fuck you.
