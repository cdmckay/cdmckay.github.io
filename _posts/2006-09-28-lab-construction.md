      Yeah, and who are these people who come to your place and complain about how messy... wait, hold on a tic... is this a new blog post?!!!1!11!? Sweet Jesus buhjeezus.

      Yep, Harper sure is a douchebag extraordinare. The thing that kills me is that he's being 70% reasonable right now. Surely, if he was in majority like this, I could live with it. But we all know he's playing it safe for now until he gets his majority, at which point it's free testicle electrodes for all the immigrants. And the fact that only a small percentage of the electorate can figure this out just pisses me off. There should be a quiz you should have to take before you can vote. You should also have to be part of a particular gender, ethnicity and income bracket, too, but that's for another blog comment.

      PS: Did Smidgie's get their liquor license back yet? And, if so, what's the point if I'm not in town?

Ahoy! I'm updating! So, quite a bit has happened in the months that have passed. I've moved twice (I'm now at Frontenac and Union) and am nearly done my thesis! Hurray!

Onto other things. Harper as PM = boo-urns. I was reading yet another article about him on CBC.ca and I began thinking: How did this douchebag get to be PM? I don't know. I'm hating this US-style patriotism talk, too. For instance, if someone in the House mentions anything about an Afghanistan pull-out, then Harper drops the "how can you question the war while our troops are dying? aren't you patriot?" I want to punch his ugly face in. I hate him. I hate his "I'm your father, I know what's best" attitude.

Next. The lab is having a ceiling put in to (partially) cover the overhanging pipes. Great! However, the implementation is a little fucked. Apparently, whomever conceived of the plan, thought it would be completely accaeptable to have the workmen come in one day, move all the shit around in the lab, put nine tiles up, and then leave for 3 weeks. Then they come back today, do a little more work, and leave. At this pace, they might be done by the time I'm leaving in Decemeber. Brilliant, just brilliant. Because, y'know, having half the lab as a permanent construction zone helps me work better. The drilling and hammering is nice too. Now I don't have to intentionally distract myself anymore.

That brings me to my next criticism. When the Powers That Be decided to put this ceiling in, there was no discussion with us, the people who actually use the lab. Nope, the Powers just decided it was a good idea.

Anyway, that's it for now.
