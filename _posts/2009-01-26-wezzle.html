<p>So you're probably wondering what's up with Wezzle?</p>
<p>Since Test6, we've added quite a bit of stuff and are moving quickly towards a release.&nbsp; However, a lot remains to be done.&nbsp; Here's some of the new stuff we've added since Test6:</p>
<ul>
<li>An updated Play Now menu that has a look consistent across all menues.</li>
<li>An achievements browser, that allows you to scroll through all achievements in the game and to see which ones you have done, and when.</li>
<li>An in-game achievement notification.&nbsp; In fact, we've added a general notification system that will give you tips and other information as the game progresses (these can be turned off, of course).</li>
<li>Improved line sounds.&nbsp; As you get more and more line chains, the line sound increases by a semi-tone.&nbsp; It's quite exciting.</li>
<li>An improved tile dropping algorithm.&nbsp; You now get fewer random drop-in lines, so that the game no longer feels like it plays itself.</li>
<li>An improved, peripheral timer.&nbsp; When you get up to level 10 like the big boys, you need to have a better idea of how much time you have.&nbsp; Our new timer does just that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are just the things I can think of.&nbsp; There's been numerous small bugfixes and graphical updates that would be too tedious to list here.</p>
<p>Since we've added some many new things, it's almost time to make a new release.&nbsp; Beta testers should expect the release of Test7 in the next couple weeks.&nbsp; If you are not a beta tester, and would like to participate in testing Wezzle, contact us <a href="mailto:dev@couchware.ca">here</a>.</p>
