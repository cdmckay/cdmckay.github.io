  content: This only centers the dialog if the main browser window is maximized.  If
    the main browser window is not maximized, and not centered on the desktop, the
    popup is neither centered on the desktop, nor centered on the main browser window.

  content: You're right. I noticed that as soon as I started using this code in a
    production app and made changes to fix that problem.  I'll try to post an updated
    version soon.

<p>As someone who has had to write a lot of IE-only code (against my will, I swear!), I was pleased to hear that Firefox 3.0 added support for the IE JavaScript function <code>window.showModalDialog</code>.  Being in the middle of re-writing an IE-only web application, I thought this would simplify rewriting the modal dialogs to be compatible with both browsers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't think the folks at Mozilla put their best effort into this one.  </p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>First of all, the Firefox implementation only supports a subset of the IE options.  Here's a table showing what each browsers implementation supports according to their documentation:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th colspan="3">Documented Support</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Option</th>
<th><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536759%28VS.85%29.aspx">Internet Explorer</a></th>
<th><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Window.showModalDialog">Firefox</a></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dialogWidth</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dialogHeight</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dialogLeft</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dialogTop</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>center</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dialogHide</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td><strong>No</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>edge</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td><strong>No</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>resizable</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>scroll</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>status</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td><strong>No</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>unadorned</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td><strong>No</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Doesn't seem too bad, right?  We still have <code>center</code>, <code>resizable</code> and <code>scroll</code> right? Right? <em>Wrong.</em> </p>
<h3>Documentation != Implementation</h3>
<p>It seems the guys who wrote the Firefox documentation weren't the same guys who wrote the code. Including <code>center</code>, <code>resizable</code> or <code>scroll</code> in your arguments string has no effect whatsoever.  In fact, <code>center</code> is supposed to be <code>on</code> by default, but I can tell you right now that the modal dialog sure as hell isn't centered.</p>
<p>Here's an updated support matrix:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th colspan="3">Actual Support</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Option</th>
<th>Internet Explorer</th>
<th>Firefox</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dialogWidth</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dialogHeight</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dialogLeft</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dialogTop</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>center</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td><strong>No</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dialogHide</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td><strong>No</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>edge</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td><strong>No</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>resizable</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td><strong>No</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>scroll</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td><strong>No</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>status</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td><strong>No</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>unadorned</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td><strong>No</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Fortunately, they did get one part right: the dialog is modal.  Woooo!</p>
<h3>Can we fix it?</h3>
<p>Well, we can, kinda.  We can't fix <code>resizable</code>, because that's a property of the window, and we can't fix <code>scroll</code> for the same reason.  We can, however, emulate the <code>center</code> option by using <code>dialogLeft</code> and <code>dialogTop</code>.  Here's some quick-and-dirty code I wrote to do that.</p>
<pre lang="javascript">
var oldShowModalDialog = window.showModalDialog;
window.showModalDialog = function(url, args, options)
{           
  // Convert the options string into an object.
  var pairs = options.replace(/\s+/g, "").split(";");
  var option = {};
  $.each(pairs, function()
  {
    var pair = this.split(":");
    if (pair.length != 2) return true;
            
    option[pair[0]] = pair[1];
  });
      
  // Get the width and height of the document.
  var width = $(document).width();
  var height = $(document).height();
      
  // Get the width and height of the dialog.
  var dialogWidth = option.dialogWidth.replace("px", ""); 
  var dialogHeight = option.dialogHeight.replace("px", "");
      
  // Calculate where the dialog needs to be to be
  // centered.
  var dialogLeft = (width - dialogWidth) / 2;
  var dialogTop = (height - dialogHeight) / 2;
      
  // Add those settings to the options string.
  options += "dialogLeft: " + dialogLeft + "; ";
  options += "dialogTop: " + dialogTop + "; ";
      
  // Call the original function.
  return oldShowModalDialog(url, args, options);
};
</pre>
<p>Although this code uses <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, you could easily rewrite it to use vanilla JavaScript.</p>
<h3>Will it be fixed soon?</h3>
<p>Firefox has had <code>showModalDialog</code> since 3.0.  So naturally, you'd have assumed they'd have fixed this bug in 3.5, right?  Nope!  The bug still exists in 3.5.  Thus, I wouldn't hold my breath on this one being fixed anytime soon.</p>
