<p>I recently spent a couple hours yesterday to fix a problem I was having with my custom <code>EnumStringType</code> (see <a href="{{ '/how-to-put-spaces-in-your-nhibernate-enums' | relative_url }}">this post</a>).</p>
<p>Basically, what was happening was when my repository was making a call to <code>ICriteria<FooType>.List()</code>, which in turn called the <code>Set</code> method of <code>EnumStringType</code>, it was always passing in a lowercase string instead of an enum instance.  </p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>For example, when I used a debugger to see what the <code>object value</code> argument was in this method:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// 
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="cmd"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name="value"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name="index"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
public override void Set(IDbCommand cmd, object value, int index)
{
  var par = (IDataParameter) cmd.Parameters[index];
  if (value == null)
  {
    par.Value = DBNull.Value;
  }
  else
  {
    par.Value = Enum.Format(ReturnedClass, value, "G");
  }
}
</pre>
<p>... it would show up as an "foo" string instead of a <code>FooEnum.Foo</code> enum object.</p>
<p>What was the problem?  It turns out in my repository I was setting on of my criteria like this:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
var criteria = Session.CreateCriteria<FooType>
  .Add( Expression.Eq("EnumField", FooEnum.Foo).IgnoreCase() );
</pre>
<p>Looks innocuous, does it not?  Take a closer look: notice the <code>IgnoreCase()</code> call?  That's what was causing it.  It was there because previously I had not been using an enum and I had forgotten to remove it.  That little sucker cost me 3 hours of my life.  </p>
<p>Hopefully I saved you that time :)</p>
