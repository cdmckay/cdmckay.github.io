<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>This is not the way Fep arrays will work.  <a href="/blogs/cam/2009/07/29/fep-collections/">Refer to the new article on Fep collections for more information</a>.</em></p>
<p>In this article, I'll write a bit about how I think Fep arrays will look.  Keep in mind this a work in progress and is by no means comprehensive.  Without further ado...</p>
<p>In PHP, you define an array using the <code>array()</code> construct.  Fep will follow the lead of languages like JavaScript, Python, Ruby and Groovy and use the square bracket </code>[]</code> notation.</p>
<h3>Initialization</h3>
<p>For example, a simple array in PHP is creating like this:</p>
<pre lang="php">
$arr = array(1, 2, 3);
</pre>
<p>In Fep, this would be done like this:</p>
<pre lang="php">
arr = [1, 2, 3]
</pre>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>There are actually three things to notice here.  First, Fep uses square brackets.  Second, Fep has optional semicolons (similar to JavaScript and Scala).  Third, Fep doesn't prefix all variables with <code>$</code>.  This should give your pinky finger a bit of rest and de-noise-ify your Fep code.</p>
<p>How about associative arrays?  In this case, I don't want to deviate too much from PHP, so I'm going to go with the same syntax:</p>
<pre lang="php">
// PHP
$fruits = array(
  "fruits"  => array("a" => "orange", "b" => "banana", 
                     "c" => "apple"),
  "numbers" => array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
  "holes"   => array("first", 5 => "second", "third")
);

// Fep
fruits = 
[
  "fruits"  => ["a" => "orange", "b" => "banana", 
                "c" => "apple"],
  "numbers" => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
  "holes"   => ["first", 5 => "second", "third")
]
</pre>
<h3>Decomposition</h3>
<p>What about that convenient <code>list</code> construct?  In Fep, we'll try again to reduce the typing and improve readability by introducing this syntax:</p>
<pre lang="php">
// PHP
list($a, $b, $c) = array("a", "b", "c");

// Fep
a, b, c = ["a", "b", "c"]
</pre>
<h3>Accessors</h3>
<p>To fetch a value from a Fep array, the regular PHP-style accessors will be used, with the main difference being that Fep will support negative indexing.  That is, <code>$array[-1]&nbsp;==&nbsp;$array[$array.length&nbsp;-&nbsp;1]</code>.</p>
<pre lang="php">
arr = [1, 2, 3]
println $arr[0]    // 1
println [4, 5, 6][1] // 5
println $arr[-1]   // 3

mixed = ["a" => "b", "foo"]
println arr["a"] // b
println arr[0]   // foo
</pre>
<h3>API</h3>
<p>All arrays in Fep will be <code>Array</code> objects.  As such, they'll have access to all the PHP array functions in an object-oriented way.  Here's a few examples:</p>
<pre lang="php">
// PHP
$arr = array(1, 2, "x");
$len = count($arr);
array_push($arr, "y", "z");
in_array(1, $arr);
$merged = array_merge($arr, array("a", "b", "c"));

// Fep
arr = [1, 2, "x"]
len = arr.length
arr.push("y", "z")
arr.contains(1)
merged = arr + ["a", "b", "c"]
</pre>
