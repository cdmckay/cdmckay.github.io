<p>As I've made up my mind to learn Flash, and don't want to pay a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/">honkin'</a> <a href="http://www.fdt.powerflasher.com/">amount</a> of cash, I decided to go with <a href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/wikidocs/index.php?title=Main_Page">a free Flash IDE called FlashDevelop</a>.</p>
<p>Since I'm toying around with the idea of sidescrollers, I did a search for "Flash sidescroller tutorial" and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQN4VyUVj3Y&amp;NR=1">found this excellent 3-parter</a> by <a href="http://devnote.org">devnote.org</a>.&nbsp; Unfortunately (for me), the tutorial expects that you're using Adobe's Flash IDE.&nbsp; Thus, as a contribution to the web (and myself... mostly myself), I translated the tutorial to work with FlashDevelop.&nbsp; Read on to see how I did it, or <a href="{{ '/files/BasicSidescrollerTutorial.zip' | relative_url }}">just grab the source here</a>.</p>
<p><!--more-->There are basically only 3 elements in the DevNote tutorial that require the Flash IDE.&nbsp; They are the Boundaries, Player and StartMarker MovieClips.</p>
<p>As the StartMarker was just a point, I used the Point class to represent it (and called it <code>_startPos</code> instead).  Since Boundaries and Player were basically sprites, I represented them using the Sprite class.  Here is the pertinent code:</p>
<pre lang="actionscript3">
public class Main extends MovieClip 
{
    private var _startPos:Point;
    private var _player:Sprite;
    private var _boundaries:Sprite;    
    ...
    public function Main():void {
        // Assign defaults.
        _startPos = new Point(100, 10);
 
        _player = new Sprite();
        _player.graphics.beginFill(0xff0000);
        _player.graphics.drawRect(-10, -50, 20, 50);
        _player.graphics.endFill();
        _player.x = _startPos.x;
        _player.y = _startPos.y;
        addChild(_player);
 
        _boundaries = new Sprite();
        _boundaries.graphics.beginFill(0x0000ff);
        _boundaries.graphics.drawRect(40, 100, 110, 20);
        _boundaries.graphics.drawRect(100, 150, 110, 20);
        _boundaries.graphics.lineStyle(20, 0x0000ff);
        _boundaries.graphics.moveTo(200, 300);
        _boundaries.graphics.lineTo(500, 100);
        _boundaries.graphics.moveTo(500, 100);
        _boundaries.graphics.lineTo(600, 100);
        _boundaries.graphics.moveTo(800, 200);
        _boundaries.graphics.lineTo(500, 200);
        _boundaries.graphics.endFill();
        addChild(_boundaries);
        ...
    }    
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>I also change the code slightly in the case of the key handlers (I used constants for the key codes isntead of magic numbers) and used a <code>do ... while</code> loop for the collision detection.</p>
