<p>While working on Flash sidescroller stuff I noticed that there was no easy way (that I could find) to create multiple sprites from a single bitmap (something you'd do when doing a tile-based graphics layout).</p>
<p>Sooo... <a href="http://cdmckay.org/blog/projects/spritefactory">I made my own simple library called SpriteFactory</a>.</p>
<p>Here's some example usage:</p>
<pre lang="actionscript3">
var factory:SpriteFactory = new SpriteFactory("assets/sprites");
factory.loadBitmap("grass", "block-grass.png");
var grass1:Sprite = factory.newSprite("grass");
var grass2:Sprite = factory.newSprite("grass");
</pre>
