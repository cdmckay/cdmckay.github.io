<p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/matthijs/C-40-and-beyond-by-Anders-Hejlsberg/">Channel 9 has posted a great talk</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg">Anders Hejlsberg</a>, the original author of Turbo Pascal, the chief architect of Delphi, and the lead architect of C#.</p>
<p>History lesson: Anders was <a href="http://news.cnet.com/2009-1023-229218.html">lured away from Borland by Microsoft</a> with a hefty offer of a $1.5 million signing bonus, a base salary of up to $200,000, and options to buy 75,000 shares of Microsoft stock.</p></blockquote>
<p>Looks like it was worth it, as each C# release has added many interesting and powerful features, while maintaining a fine balance between complexity and simplicity.</p>
