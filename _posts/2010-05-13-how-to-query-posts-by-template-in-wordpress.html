<p>Ever wanted to filter a query_posts call by template?  If you're reading this post, you probably have or need to right now.  You probably went to <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/query_posts">the query_posts documentation</a> and scanned for something like "template=foo" and were deeply disappointed.  Then maybe, in an act of desperation, you started to trudge around <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">the plugin library</a>.  Stop!  Stop right there!  You don't need a plugin to do this.  Everything you need is already in <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Let's start with a question: how does WordPress associate templates?  The answer: as a secret custom field.  What's a custom field, you ask?  They're those useful little suckers under the content area in the WP editor:</p>
<p><a href="http://cdmckay.org/blog/wp-content/blogs.dir/2/files/2010/05/wordpress-custom-fields.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1522" title="WordPress Custom Fields" src="http://cdmckay.org/blog/wp-content/blogs.dir/2/files/2010/05/wordpress-custom-fields.png" alt="" width="300" height="406" /></a></p>
<p>But if the template is a custom field, you ask, then how come I don't see it down there?  Well, I just said they're secret.  After poking around WP database, I discovered the template for a page is determined by the custom field name <code>_wp_page_template</code>.  My suspicion is that anything with the prefix _wp is hidden from the WP admin area and therefore secret.</p>
<h3>Harnessing the awesome power of custom fields</h3>
<p>On the bright side, even if you can't see the <code>_wp_page_template</code> in the custom fields area, I can assure you it's still there.  And if it's there, you can use it in any of your nefarious schemes.</p>
<p>Query_posts provides 3 parameters relating to custom fields: meta_key, meta_value, and meta_compare.  With those in mind, imagine you have a template called Profile (profile.php), and you want to exclude any page that is a Profile from our query.  In order to do that, you'd would make a query_posts call like so:</p>
<pre lang="php">
query_posts(array(
    'post_type' => 'page',
    'meta_key' => '_wp_page_template',
    'meta_value' => 'profile.php',
    'meta_compare' => '!='
));
</pre>
<p>The main thing to note here is that the template is identified by the name of the PHP file (profile.php) and not by the the name of template (Profile).</p>
<h3>Wrap-up</h3>
<p>Filtering your query_posts query by template is as easy as filtering by any custom field.  No plugin required.  Just remember: use the PHP file name as the template identifier, not the template name.</p>
