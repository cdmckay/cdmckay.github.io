I am currently the CTO of [Process Street](https://www.process.st), a company I co-founded in 2014. 

These days, I principally code in Scala, JavaScript and SQL, but have familiarity with a diverse range of programming languages including Java, C# and PHP. Although most of my experience lies with web applications and sites, I am interested in programming in nearly any domain.
