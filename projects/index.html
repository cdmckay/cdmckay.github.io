<h3><a href="{{ '/projects/dnum' | relative_url }}">Dnum</a></h3>
<p>Dnum is an LGPL licensed static class for accessing enumeration values much like the  built-in .NET Enum class. Unlike Enum, Dnum is type-safe, reducing the  number of enum-related runtime errors and eliminating the need for  tedious, error-prone and inelegant down-casts.</p>
<p>Dnum also transparently supports the DescriptionAttribute attribute,  which allows you to conveniently use spaces and other characters in your  enumeration constants.</p>
<h3><a href="{{ '/projects/spritefactory' | relative_url }}">SpriteFactory</a></h3>
<p>SpriteFactory is a BSD licensed ActionScript 3 library that makes it easy to generate multiple sprites from a bitmap image (like a JPG, PNG or GIF) without needing to use multiple loaders.</p>
<h3><a href="{{ '/projects/fep' | relative_url }}">Fep</a></h3>
<p>Fep is a new programming language that compiles into PHP. Fep aims to provide a less noisy syntax, <a href="{{ '/projects/olivine' | relative_url }}">a more consistent object-oriented programming</a> API (based on Microsoft&rsquo;s .NET framework), and interop with existing PHP code.</p>
<h3><a href="{{ '/projects/olivine' | relative_url }}">Olivine</a></h3>
<p>Olivine is a .NET (and Java and Objective-C) inspired PHP class library that attempts to provide a coherent and useful type hierarchy for PHP.</p>
<h3><a href="{{ '/projects/arrayzing' | relative_url }}">Arrayzing</a></h3>
<p>Arrayzing (a contraction of &ldquo;array&rdquo; and &ldquo;amazing&rdquo;) was a partially finished JavaScript array manipulation library with a syntax similar to jQuery.  It was intended to do for arrays what jQuery did for the DOM.</p>
<h3><a href="{{ '/projects/jss' | relative_url }}">JSS</a></h3>
<p>JSS  (JavaScript Stylesheets) is a JavaScript implementation of CSS. JSS allows you to define your stylesheets in JavaScript using a CSS-like syntax. JSS also offers non-programmers a simplified CSS-like way to access advanced features of jQuery like events.</p>
